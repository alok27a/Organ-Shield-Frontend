## üí° Inspiration

Organ donation and organ trafficking are significant global health issues that pose ethical and legal challenges. There is a significant shortage of available organs for transplantation compared to the demand, resulting in the emergence of an illegal market for organs. This black market exploits and takes advantage of vulnerable individuals, who are coerced into selling their organs for transplant purposes. To address these issues, this research proposes using blockchain technology as a tool for improving transparency and traceability in the organ donation and transplantation process. The platform is built on top of the Polygon blockchain, using smart contracts to automate various aspects of the process, such as verifying donor and recipient identities, managing organ matching, and releasing organ donation records. Patient information is securely stored using MongoDB, while decentralized digital identities ensure data security and privacy. An administrative dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for managing the system, and regular data analytics and monitoring track key metrics. The use of blockchain technology has the potential to improve the safety and ethical integrity of the organ transplantation process, combat organ trafficking, and improve the availability of lifesaving organ transplants.

## üìå About the Product

* The product described¬† is a secure and transparent platform for organ donation and transplantation, which utilizes blockchain technology. The platform includes a range of components, such as a blockchain platform built on top of the Polygon layer 2 solution for Ethereum, smart contracts, patient information databases, identity management, an administrative dashboard, and analytics.
* The proposed platform is unique in several ways, including the automated organ compatibility testing, which is achieved using neural networks, and the tamper-proof record of every step in the organ donation and transplantation process, which is secured on the blockchain. The use of smart contracts and identity management also ensures that only authorized individuals have access to patient information and organ donation records, which helps to prevent unauthorized access and potential exploitation by individuals involved in organ trafficking.
* Overall, this platform aims to address the concerns of organ trafficking and provide a secure and transparent solution for organ donation and transplantation. The use of blockchain technology ensures that the records are tamper-proof and transparent, while the implementation of smart contracts and identity management helps to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to patient information and organ donation records. The proposed platform offers a unique and innovative solution to the challenges of organ donation and transplantation, and has the potential to improve the performance and impact of existing systems.

## ü§î What it does ?

* The platform automates the compatibility testing process between organs and potential recipients using neural networks based on historical data. However, medical experts should evaluate the results generated by the algorithms, taking into account other factors before deciding which organ to transplant.
* The platform aims to create a tamper-proof record of every step in the organ donation and transplantation process secured on the blockchain, making it difficult to modify or manipulate. It also uses smart contracts and identity management to prevent unauthorized access and potential exploitation by individuals involved in organ trafficking.

## ‚öíÔ∏è How we built it ?

* **Front-End**: We have used ReactJS and Chakra UI to create a simple, elegant and minimalist user interface that meets our design requirements and maximises efficiency.
* **Back-End**: We have used several JS 'npm' packages, as well as NodeJS as a runtime environment to create an effective and effortless back-end module.
* **Storage**: We have used MongoDB for storing all the user informations.

## üí™ Challenges we ran into

* Data Availability and Quality: To train the neural network for the compatibility testing, a significant amount of high-quality historical data is required. However, the availability and quality of such data can be limited, which may impact the accuracy of the compatibility predictions.

* Integration with Existing Systems: The proposed platform needs to be integrated with existing medical systems and processes, which can be a complex and time-consuming process. Integration may require significant changes to existing infrastructure and processes, which can cause disruption and resistance from stakeholders.

* Regulatory Compliance: The platform needs to comply with regulatory requirements for the medical industry, which can be stringent and time-consuming to meet. Compliance with these regulations is critical to ensure patient safety and the legality of the organ donation and transplantation process.

* Security and Privacy: The platform's security and privacy measures need to be robust to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patient information and organ donation records. Any breaches of security or privacy could lead to the exploitation of vulnerable individuals and undermine the credibility of the platform.

* Adoption and Acceptance: The success of the proposed platform depends on its adoption and acceptance by stakeholders, including medical professionals, patients, and regulatory bodies. Convincing these stakeholders of the benefits of the platform and addressing any concerns they may have can be a significant challenge.
