## üí° Inspiration

Organ donation and organ trafficking are significant global health issues that pose ethical and legal challenges. There is a significant shortage of available organs for transplantation compared to the demand, resulting in the emergence of an illegal market for organs. This black market exploits and takes advantage of vulnerable individuals, who are coerced into selling their organs for transplant purposes. To address these issues, this research proposes using blockchain technology as a tool for improving transparency and traceability in the organ donation and transplantation process. The platform is built on top of the Polygon blockchain, using smart contracts to automate various aspects of the process, such as verifying donor and recipient identities, managing organ matching, and releasing organ donation records. Patient information is securely stored using MongoDB, while decentralized digital identities ensure data security and privacy. An administrative dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for managing the system, and regular data analytics and monitoring track key metrics. The use of blockchain technology has the potential to improve the safety and ethical integrity of the organ transplantation process, combat organ trafficking, and improve the availability of lifesaving organ transplants.

## üìå About the Product

* The product described¬† is a secure and transparent platform for organ donation and transplantation, which utilizes blockchain technology. The platform includes a range of components, such as a blockchain platform built on top of the Polygon layer 2 solution for Ethereum, smart contracts, patient information databases, identity management, an administrative dashboard, and analytics.
* The proposed platform is unique in several ways, including the automated organ compatibility testing, which is achieved using neural networks, and the tamper-proof record of every step in the organ donation and transplantation process, which is secured on the blockchain. The use of smart contracts and identity management also ensures that only authorized individuals have access to patient information and organ donation records, which helps to prevent unauthorized access and potential exploitation by individuals involved in organ trafficking.
* Overall, this platform aims to address the concerns of organ trafficking and provide a secure and transparent solution for organ donation and transplantation. The use of blockchain technology ensures that the records are tamper-proof and transparent, while the implementation of smart contracts and identity management helps to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to patient information and organ donation records. The proposed platform offers a unique and innovative solution to the challenges of organ donation and transplantation, and has the potential to improve the performance and impact of existing systems.

## ü§î What it does ?

* Our **base idea** is to provide users with a utility software that acts a **password wallet cum manager** that uses the current developments in **decentralized storage architecture** to provide them with a platform that saves all their passwords in a manner that makes them impenetrable.
* We use the **cutting-edge IPFS system** to store our user's passwords after encrypting the data via the **AES algorithm**. We require only a single field for registration on our software, a **master password**, and return a **unique 'secret' key** that the user must protect at all costs.
* With the combination that of the password and the key, that is given to our users, we create a simple **hack-proof** system that protects all the data of our users at a nominal cost. This same system can have **immense future prospects**.

## ‚öíÔ∏è How we built it ?

* **Front-End**: We used ReactJS and Chakra UI to create a simple, elegant and minimalist user interface that meets our design requirements and maximises efficiency.
* **Back-End**: We used several JS 'npm' packages, as well as NodeJS as a runtime environment to create an effective and effortless back-end module.
* **Storage**: We used the decentralized IPFS framework via pre-built node packages to create custom APIs that cater to our software.
* **Security**: Most importantly, we use the modern AES algorithm, along with BcryptJS and JSON Web Token to ensure complete security.

## üí™ Challenges we ran into

* Ensuring that at no place did we store or use our **user's secret key**.
* Coming up with a sound **business plan** for a project that can very well be in the publc service domain.
* Overcoming various errors as we learned how to use the **IPFS system** for the first time.
* Overcoming various **CORS** errors by trial and error when trying to integrate the **back-end API** with the front-end architecture.

## ‚ú® Accomplishments that we're proud of

* Our **USP** that we made **innovative use** of **modern storage** and **encryption systems** that make it essentially impervious to any and all attacks.
* Combine that with the **minimalistic design** and **efficient software** development, and we have the perfect password utility tool for our times.
* We have created a system in which the data is **double encrypted** and the **master password** is never saved or transferred. The user has the ownership of it's own data.

## üìö What we learned

* Learned how to use **IPFS**.
* Various new **ReactJS** and **NPM** packages that we used at various places in the front and back-end.
* Implementing **IPFS-API** with **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS** to store and retrieve data.

## üõ°Ô∏è Features

* Trustless
* Zero Knowledge Architecture.
* Progressive Web App that is responsive on all platforms and devices.
* Strong encryption base with AES256, JSON Web Token and bcryptJS.
* Fully open-source with code transparency.
* Simple, minimilistic UI.

## üí∏ Business Model

### Our Customer Base üë§

* Our core customer base is basically **everyone using the internet today**.
* We hope to give them a **completely secure password wallet** and hopefully **inform and empower** them to **take charge of their own data**.

### Revenue Streams üí∞

* We will charge a **nominal fee for registration**.
* **Minimal ads** added to the website.
* We hope to **officially partner with various governments** and offer them our services to ensure data privacy and security.

### Cost Structure üí≤

* Smart and efficient **marketing** will require some investment.
* As the software grows in scale and the customer base becomes large, investment will be required for **scaling up storage**.

## üöÄ What's next for Safe Chain

* Our **project's end goal** is to educate everyone on the earth about the **value and worth of their own data** and have them **take responsible ownership** of it.
* While this technology starts as a **simple password-wallet utility software**, we hope to have **all the data** that is collected for one person be under their **own ownership**, such that whenever it is sold somewhere, they **receive a commission**.
* Moreover, we hope to **implement further web extensions** that **save all the passwords** that you create for every new account, after encrypting it, so that **no one can access that data**.
